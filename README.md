# What is the Candid Forum?
Officially launched around 2011–2012, The Candid Forum is hosted on a custom vBulletin platform and protected by Cloudflare 

The site includes numerous private sections dedicated to:

Candid pictures and videos (spandex tight jeans beach/bikini sports feet) 

Publicly accessible galleries.

With hundreds of thousands of posts and over 200,000 registered users, it’s clearly popular in certain circles .

# Content: What Bytes Lies Beneath?
The forum prominently features “creepshots”—photos taken in public without people's awareness—alongside more clearly illegal “upskirt” images, particularly of minors or people in school uniforms 

Enforcement of “18+ only” is largely self-regulated and opaque. Users frequently point out there's a separate “Teen” or “Jailbait” category 

# Legality and Ethical Ramifications
⚖️ Legal Context
Creepshots of clothed adults in public often fall into a legal gray area (though many consider them privacy violations).

Upskirt photos, especially involving minors or intimate body parts, are explicitly illegal in many countries, including the US 

Distributing such images may violate both unlawful surveillance and non-consensual pornography laws
